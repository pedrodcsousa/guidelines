# Guidelines
conceptual style-guide for our starters

The objective of this open source github organization is to hold a collection of starters that behave identically in all Front End frameworks in terms of conceptual architecture.

The starters all meet the following requirements:

- 💆 less than 3 short iterations from it's framework's most used CLI
- 💫 redux (with multiple, lazy-loaded, unit tested stores)
- ❄️ environment variables
- ✈️ aliases for globally relevant folders/modules
- ⭐️ 100% Page Speed Rating
- 🦉 style-guide/generator for:
  - crearting components
  - creating routes
  - creating stores
  - documenting *bad code*
- 🙅 no SSR (or optionable)
- 🎅 command for deploying as an S3 static website

The Frameworks we would like to support are:
- React
- Angular
- Preact
- Vue
- Ember
